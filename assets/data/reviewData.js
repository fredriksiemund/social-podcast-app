      "Revising my initial review. After a good deal of troubleshooting, I was able to get them to work. I've already discussed edits to the manual with customer service as well. I will give them credit, they were responsive and really tried to help me. For those who are buying, remember to take the protective tape off the earbuds or they won't connect to the case!",
